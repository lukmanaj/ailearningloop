This to me, is the beginning of my Python journey. Prior to Arewa, I had only learnt theoretically and had no IDE installed on my laptop. I also only used colab to practice on rare ocassions. After joining Arewa, I was forced to install VSCode and practice daily. Our mentor, Shamsuddeen always says that he wants us to imbibe atomic habits, based on the famous book by James Clear.
