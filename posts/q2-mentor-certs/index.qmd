I'm excited to share a milestone that reflects my commitment to giving back to the AI learning community. 

Over the past quarter, I've had the privilege of serving as a **Mentor** in the [DeepLearning.AI](https://www.deeplearning.ai) Discourse forums, supporting learners in their journey through two impactful specializations:

- üß† **Data Analytics Professional Certificate Specialization**
- ‚öôÔ∏è **TensorFlow Developer Professional Certificate Specialization**

As someone who has benefited greatly from open learning communities, I know how transformative peer guidance can be. Mentoring gave me the chance to:
- Clarify concepts for others (and often for myself!),
- Share real-world insights on projects and tools,
- And most importantly, connect with passionate, curious learners from all over the globe.

I'm honored to have received these **Q2 2025 Mentor Participation Certificates** in recognition of that work:

I'm deeply thankful to the DeepLearning.AI team for creating such a thriving and inclusive space for learners and mentors alike.

Stay curious, stay generous.
