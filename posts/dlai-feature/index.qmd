A significant milestone in my artificial intelligence journey recently materialized when DeepLearning.AI featured my story across their global platforms. The recognition came from a forum post where I shared my experiences as a course tester and mentor, reflecting on a journey that began in January 2023 with Andrew Ng's Machine Learning Specialization.

## The Journey to Recognition

My involvement with DeepLearning.AI has been transformative. What started as enrolling in a single course evolved into a deep engagement with the AI community. As a course tester, I've had the privilege of providing feedback that helps shape the learning experience for future students. In my role as a mentor, I've guided numerous learners through the complexities of machine learning, witnessing their growth from novices to confident practitioners.

## Global Reach and Impact
The feature was shared across DeepLearning.AI's extensive social media network:

- LinkedIn showcased my journey to their professional network of AI enthusiasts
- X (formerly Twitter) broadcast my story to the global tech community

- Instagram captured the visual narrative of my path in AI

A particularly touching moment came when my friend Abbas shared the Instagram feature with meâ€”a reminder of how supportive the tech community can be.

## Professional Growth and Future Aspirations

This recognition arrives at a pivotal moment in my career. After three enriching years at Zipline, where I applied AI to revolutionize medical delivery systems in Africa, I'm preparing for new challenges. My experience has reinforced my belief in AI's potential to transform healthcare delivery in developing regions.
The intersection of my pharmaceutical background with artificial intelligence has positioned me uniquely in the healthcare-tech space. At Zipline, I've witnessed firsthand how AI can optimize medical supply chains and improve access to healthcare in remote areas.
