I’m thrilled to share an exciting milestone in my journey—I was recently featured by DeepLearning.AI! They highlighted a post I shared on their forum, where I reflected on my journey as a course tester and mentor. This journey officially began in January last year, when I enrolled in the Machine Learning Specialization by Andrew Ng. Being recognized by such a renowned organization is truly an honor.

What made this even more special was seeing my story shared across all their social media platforms. While I’m currently active on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), and LinkedIn, a friend, Abbas, kindly sent me a screenshot of their Instagram post—so I didn’t miss out on that either!

This recognition is a testament to the hard work and dedication I’ve poured into learning, mentoring, and contributing to the AI community. It also comes at an exciting time as I prepare for the next phase of my career. Having worked at Zipline for over three years, I’m looking forward to new challenges and opportunities to grow.

This feature has bolstered my confidence and motivation as I continue striving to achieve my goals. With determination and faith, I believe that success is within reach. In sha Allah, the best is yet to come!

Thank you for reading and being part of my journey. To everyone who has supported me so far, your encouragement means the world. Let’s keep pushing boundaries together!
