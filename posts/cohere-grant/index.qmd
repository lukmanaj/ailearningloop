> _“AI is only powerful if it reaches the people who need it most.”_

It is with great pleasure that I announce to all that I’ve been selected as a **Cohere Labs Catalyst Grant** recipient!

This grant supports bold ideas that use large language models to tackle real-world problems. With Cohere’s support and $2,000 in API credits, I’m launching a project I deeply care about: **BioAid QA**, an open-source, multilingual biomedical question-answering assistant for underserved communities.

## What is BioAid QA?

**BioAid QA** is a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) assistant designed to help healthcare workers and patients access trustworthy medical information in **English, Hausa, Swahili, and French**.

It integrates **Cohere’s Command, Embed, and Rerank** models with a curated corpus of WHO and NIH resources. The system will be deployed via a lightweight **Gradio** interface and hosted on **Hugging Face Spaces**, making it accessible even in low-bandwidth settings.

---

## Technical Overview

**BioAid QA** will be built as follows:

### 1. Document Ingestion & Indexing
- Curate biomedical texts (e.g., WHO guidelines, NIH fact sheets).
- Split into passages and embed using **Cohere Embed**.
- Store embeddings in a **Chroma** index.

### 2. Multilingual Retrieval & Reranking
- User questions (in multiple languages) are embedded and matched via nearest-neighbor search.
- Passages are reranked using **Cohere Rerank** for relevance.

### 3. Answer Generation
- Top passages + query → **Cohere Command** → concise, fact-based answers.

### 4. Deployment
- Gradio frontend with language toggles.
- Client-side caching and optimized UX for slow networks.

## Research & Deliverables

This project doubles as software  and a **research contribution**. The planned deliverables include:

1. A **peer-reviewed paper** describing architecture, evaluation, and findings.
2. An MIT licensed **open-source GitHub repo**  
3. A deployed app on Hugging Face Spaces

## Follow Along

I'll be documenting the full journey — wins, failures, and findings — right here on my Quarto blog.

Stay tuned, and let’s build tools that **make health knowledge accessible for everyone.**
