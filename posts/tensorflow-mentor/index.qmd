On August 14, 2024, I reached a significant milestone in my AI career: I was officially designated as a mentor for the TensorFlow Developer Certificate program on Deep Learning.AI and Coursera. This comprehensive certification, consisting of four courses, introduces learners to the powerful TensorFlow framework. As I reflect on this achievement, I'm filled with pride and gratitude for how far I've come in such a short time.

## The TensorFlow Developer Professional Certificate

The certificate program I now mentor comprises four essential courses:

1. Introduction to TensorFlow for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning
2. Convolutional Neural Networks in TensorFlow
3. Natural Language Processing in TensorFlow
4. Sequences, Time Series and Prediction

These courses cover a broad spectrum of AI applications, from basic neural networks to advanced techniques in computer vision, natural language processing, and time series analysis.

## A Serendipitous Beginning

My AI learning journey began with the Arewa Data Science Academy fellowship, a program that holds a special place in my heart. Simultaneously, I embarked on Andrew Ng's Machine Learning Specialization on Coursera. This coincidence set the stage for my rapid progression in the AI community.

## Rising Through the Ranks

My involvement with Deep Learning.AI and Coursera deepened quickly:

- **Forum Moderator:** In November 2023, just a few months into my journey, I became a moderator at the DeepLearning.AI forum, helping to guide discussions and support learners tackling challenges in various courses offered in the community.

- **Course Tester:** I was invited to be part of the testing group for a major course upgrade, partly due to my active contribution as a moderator, where we transitioned from an older version of TensorFlow to the cutting-edge TensorFlow 2.16. My insightful feedback contributed to refining the course content and user experience across all four courses.

-  **Mentor:** The crowning achievement came in August 2024, when I was offered the opportunity to become a mentor for the TensorFlow Developer Certificate courses, in addition to my moderator role. This position allows me to guide learners through the intricacies of TensorFlow, from basic concepts to advanced applications in CNN, NLP, and time series prediction.


This rapid transition from learner to contributor to mentor and moderator has been both humbling and exhilarating.

## Celebrating Milestones and Looking Ahead

As I continue to contribute to the AI community, I'm committed to making a lasting impact in all the places I volunteer, especially at Arewa Data Science Academy, where my journey began. Each step forward reminds me of the importance of celebrating small victories while keeping an eye on future goals.

My new role as a TensorFlow Developer Certificate mentor, alongside my moderator responsibilities, is not just a personal achievement; it's an opportunity to give back to the community that has nurtured my growth. It's a chance to inspire and guide the next generation of AI enthusiasts and developers across various domains of machine learning and deep learning.

## A Message to Aspiring AI Developers

As I forge ahead in pursuing my dreams in the AI field, I'm reminded of the power of persistence, continuous learning, and community support. To all aspiring AI developers out there: keep pushing, keep learning, and remember that today's learner can be tomorrow's leader.

The path from novice to mentor can be shorter than you think. With dedication and the right opportunities, you can quickly find yourself in a position to guide others. Embrace every chance to learn, contribute, and grow within the AI community.

Here's to the journey ahead, filled with neural networks, convolutional layers, natural language models, time series predictions, and the endless possibilities of artificial intelligence!
