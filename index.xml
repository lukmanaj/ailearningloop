  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I‚Äôm excited to share a milestone that reflects my commitment to giving back to the AI learning community.</p>
<p>Over the past quarter, I‚Äôve had the privilege of serving as a <strong>Mentor</strong> in the <a href="https://www.deeplearning.ai">DeepLearning.AI</a> Discourse forums, supporting learners in their journey through two impactful specializations:</p>
<ul>
<li>üß† <strong>Data Analytics Professional Certificate Specialization</strong></li>
<li>‚öôÔ∏è <strong>TensorFlow Developer Professional Certificate Specialization</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>As someone who has benefited greatly from open learning communities, I know how transformative peer guidance can be. Mentoring gave me the chance to: - Clarify concepts for others (and often for myself!), - Share real-world insights on projects and tools, - And most importantly, connect with passionate, curious learners from all over the globe.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm honored to have received these <strong>Q2 2025 Mentor Participation Certificates</strong> in recognition of that work: <img src="https://lukmanaj.github.io/ailearningloop/posts/q2-mentor-certs/DAG-Q2-mentor.png" class="img-fluid"> <img src="https://lukmanaj.github.io/ailearningloop/posts/q2-mentor-certs/TF1-Q2-mentor.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>I‚Äôm deeply thankful to the DeepLearning.AI team for creating such a thriving and inclusive space for learners and mentors alike.</p>
<p>Stay curious, stay generous.</p>

  <title>On Earning a Hackathon Certificate</title>
  <dc:creator>Lukman Aliyu Jibril</dc:creator>
  <link>https://lukmanaj.github.io/ailearningloop/posts/agents-hackathon/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Participating in the Gradio Agents MCP Hackathon last month was an incredible experience. Thanks to generous API credits from providers like Mistral, OpenAI, Anthropic, and others, I found myself with nearly $400 worth of credits to explore. Drowning in so many APIs pushed me to experiment, learn, and grow as an AI developer.</p>
<p>I submitted two distinct projects to the competition. Although I didn‚Äôt win a prize, the process taught me invaluable lessons‚Äîfrom designing multi-agent workflows to integrating conversational tools with custom prompts. And best of all, I received a certificate recognizing my active participation and project submissions.</p>
<p>Receiving that certificate felt like a badge of honor. It reminds me that each hackathon is an opportunity not only to compete, but to sharpen my skills and connect with the community. I‚Äôm especially grateful to Hugging Face for organizing this event and supporting developers like me.</p>
<p>Next stop: Deep Learning Indaba! I‚Äôm confident that the insights and hands‚Äëon experience I‚Äôve gained will make me a stronger contender this year. In shƒÅ æ AllƒÅh, my winning time will come‚ÄîI‚Äôll keep building, learning, and participating.</p>
<p>Here‚Äôs a snapshot of my certificate:</p>

  <title>Exploring Power BI</title>
  <dc:creator>Lukman Aliyu Jibril</dc:creator>
  <link>https://lukmanaj.github.io/ailearningloop/posts/power-bi/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Fifteen days ago, I hit a major personal milestone: a <strong>500-day streak</strong> on DataCamp. After immersing myself in AI-related courses for months, I decided to take a short detour to revisit a different domain‚Äî<strong>data analytics</strong>. So this week, I focused on completing the <a href="https://www.datacamp.com/completed/statement-of-accomplishment/track/12b5958754200636ba45352dc12c8007e8c5a30b">Power BI Fundamentals</a> track on DataCamp.</p>
<p>I sprinted through the track.After all, I‚Äôm no longer a novice in the data world. Having recently completed and even helped shape the <strong>DeepLearning.AI Data Analytics Professional Certificate</strong>, many of the foundational ideas were already familiar. This prior experience made the learning curve gentler and the journey much more exciting.</p>
<p>Admittedly, I had some initial concerns. Power BI is closed source, and using it outside the DataCamp environment required a Windows laptop, something I don‚Äôt use by default. But I reminded myself that the value of practical, hands-on knowledge far outweighs the constraints. And <em>alhamdulillah</em>, it paid off. The skills I gained are very likely to be transferable.</p>
<p>Now that I‚Äôve completed the track, I‚Äôm setting my sights on the longer <strong>Data Analysis with Power BI</strong> track, and perhaps even the <strong>Microsoft certification</strong> eventually. Just like I hoped, diving deeper into Power BI gave me a firmer grasp of key data concepts. It was truly exhilarating.</p>
<p>I explored tools like <strong>Power Query</strong>, <strong>DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)</strong>, and became more comfortable navigating the Power BI interface. A standout experience was a full course centered around a <strong>customer churn</strong> case study. It gave me a solid, practical scenario to apply what I had learned and boosted my confidence in building analytics solutions.</p>
<p>Taking this short break from AI-focused learning reminded me how enriching it can be to return to the foundations. It gave me fresh data intuition and a renewed appreciation for the analytics process. I‚Äôm energized and looking forward to building on this momentum, and, in sha Allah, realizing even bigger dreams this year.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>R‚Äôs tidyverse has a rich visualization ecosystem that is exemplified by the popular ggplot2. In this article, I attempt to look at the different geoms and the stats linked to them.</p>
<p>Below is a list of common geom-stat pairs in ggplot2. Each pair consists of a geometric object (geom) and a statistical transformation (stat). They are closely associated because the geom specifies how the data is visually represented, while the stat determines how the data is processed before being passed to the geom.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-do-these-pairs-have-in-common">What Do These Pairs Have in Common?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Division of Responsibility: The stat processes or summarizes the raw data (e.g., counting, binning, calculating densities, or smoothing). The geom visualizes the processed data (e.g., as bars, lines, points, or polygons).</li>
<li>Interchangeability: Most geoms can work with different stats and vice versa, though the defaults are designed for common use cases. For example, geom_bar() uses stat_count by default, but you can explicitly specify stat_identity for precomputed data.</li>
<li>Defaults:Each geom has a default stat, and vice versa. These defaults are chosen to match typical use cases (e.g., geom_histogram() defaults to stat_bin).</li>
<li>Input Data: Both geoms and stats rely on mappings defined in aes() to determine how variables in the dataset relate to the plot‚Äôs structure.</li>
<li>Customization:You can override the default behavior of either the geom or the stat to fit specific needs (e.g., applying a custom statistical transformation or using a different visualization).</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="conclusion" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Geom-stat pairs in ggplot2 represent a powerful abstraction where the stat transforms data, and the geom visualizes it. While defaults streamline common tasks, their flexibility allows users to mix and match geoms and stats for a wide variety of visualizations.</p>

  <dc:creator>Lukman Aliyu Jibril</dc:creator>
  <link>https://lukmanaj.github.io/ailearningloop/posts/genomic-data-analysis/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I just completed DataCamp‚Äôs ‚ÄúAnalyzing Genomic Data in R‚Äù track, which was an incredible dive into using R and Bioconductor for genomic analysis. This track had four in-depth courses that helped me build skills for analyzing genomic datasets:</p>
<ul>
<li>Introduction to Bioconductor in R</li>
<li>RNA-Seq with Bioconductor in R</li>
<li>Differential Expression Analysis with limma in R</li>
<li>ChIP-seq with Bioconductor in R</li>
</ul>
<p>In this post, I‚Äôll briefly walk you through each course and share what I learned and why it was so exciting.</p>
<section id="introduction-to-bioconductor-in-r" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction-to-bioconductor-in-r">Introduction to Bioconductor in R</h2>
<p>This course was my gateway to Bioconductor‚Äîan essential resource for genomic analysis in R. I learned how to install packages with the BiocInstaller, work with different types of genomic data, and explore real-life datasets like those for fungi, viruses, and even plants. Tools like BioStrings, GenomicRanges, and ShortRead made manipulating and filtering raw data surprisingly accessible.</p>
<p>One highlight was learning to use built-in datasets (BSgenome and TxDb) and apply functions to search for patterns in genomic sequences. Quality control was another important aspect, using ShortRead and Rqc to ensure that my data was clean and usable‚Äîa crucial step in genomic research.</p>
</section>
<section id="rna-seq-with-bioconductor-in-r" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="rna-seq-with-bioconductor-in-r">RNA-Seq with Bioconductor in R</h2>
<p>In this course, I got hands-on with RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) data, focusing on differential expression analysis‚Äîidentifying genes that express differently between experimental conditions. I used DESeq2 to analyze gene expression between fibrosis and normal samples, which was a powerful introduction to understanding biological significance in genomics.</p>
<p>An interesting takeaway was the reminder that data interpretation doesn‚Äôt stop at identifying significant genes. I learned that experimental validation is key‚Äîaround 5% of ‚Äúsignificant‚Äù results are false positives, and ensuring that our findings are accurate requires lab-based verification. Additionally, I explored how functional analysis can help us see the biological meaning behind the data by identifying enriched processes or pathways.</p>
</section>
<section id="differential-expression-analysis-with-limma-in-r" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="differential-expression-analysis-with-limma-in-r">Differential Expression Analysis with limma in R</h2>
<p>This course added another layer to my understanding of differential expression‚Äîspecifically using limma, a versatile and widely-used Bioconductor package. I visualized gene expression levels with plotDensities and normalized raw data to ensure reliable analysis. One key aspect was principal component analysis (plotMDS), which helped me see whether data variation matched my experimental variables or if there were other technical factors at play.</p>
<p>I also learned to identify important genes using volcano plots and assess results using p-value distributions. The course highlighted how essential quality control is, emphasizing the need for careful examination to avoid misleading conclusions. Wrapping up, I conducted gene set enrichment analysis to explore biological pathways using KEGG and Gene Ontology databases‚Äîthis really helped broaden my perspective from individual genes to broader biological systems.</p>
</section>
<section id="chip-seq-with-bioconductor-in-r" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="chip-seq-with-bioconductor-in-r">ChIP-seq with Bioconductor in R</h2>
<p>ChIP-seq (Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Sequencing) was the final frontier in this track, and it was challenging but incredibly rewarding. I learned to import ChIP-seq data using rtracklayer and GenomicAlignments, visualize it with Gviz, and ensure its quality by dealing with repetitive regions through blacklisting and QC reports with ChIPQC.</p>
<p>The analysis culminated in using DiffBind to identify differentially bound peaks and create heatmaps and PCA plots to understand sample clustering. Finally, I used the chipenrich package to link peaks to nearby genes and performed enrichment analysis to see which biological processes were associated with these binding events. This part of the course really helped tie everything together and made me confident about analyzing real-world ChIP-seq data.</p>
</section>
<section id="reflections-on-the-journey" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="reflections-on-the-journey">Reflections on the Journey</h2>
<p>Completing this track gave me practical skills to handle various genomic datasets and analyze them meaningfully. Each course built on the previous one, reinforcing core concepts while adding new techniques, ultimately providing a well-rounded introduction to genomic analysis in R.</p>
<p>My next step is to apply what I‚Äôve learned to real datasets‚Äîperhaps even contribute to open research initiatives. Bioconductor‚Äôs community and support forums will be great allies as I dive deeper into genomics. As I am seriously considering grad school, this is a skill that will help me immensely in the pursuit of my goals.</p>

<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly advancing, transforming industries from healthcare to transportation. With its growing influence, there is an increasing need to ensure that AI is developed and deployed responsibly. This is where Responsible AI (RAI) comes in‚Äîa framework designed to guide the ethical use of AI, ensuring fairness, transparency, accountability, and respect for human rights. In this article, I explore the key concepts of Responsible AI, its importance, and how organizations can implement strategies that align AI development with ethical principles.</p>
<p>This article is primarily a summary of the content I learnt in the course <a href="https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/responsible-ai-practices">Responsible AI Practices</a> on DataCamp. I enrolled in this course after I had the privilege of reviewing the notebooks for the Responsible AI practicals for the upcoming Deep Learning Indaba 2024 in Dakar, Senegal. This combination of learning and practical experience has given me a well-rounded perspective on the principles of Responsible AI, which I am excited to share. I must also thank Arewa Data Science Academy for giving me the opportunity to enjoy a Data Camp scholarship, which allowed me to learn several concepts and earn relevant certifications for free.</p>
<section id="defining-responsible-ai" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="defining-responsible-ai">Defining Responsible AI</h2>
<p>Responsible AI refers to the practice of designing, developing, and deploying AI systems with an understanding of their ethical implications and societal impacts. It is about ensuring that AI systems are fair, transparent, accountable, and respectful of privacy and human rights. The goal is to create AI that benefits society without causing harm, focusing not only on the technology itself but also on the values guiding its use.</p>
</section>
<section id="why-responsible-ai-is-crucial" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-responsible-ai-is-crucial">Why Responsible AI is Crucial</h2>
<p>AI‚Äôs ability to process vast amounts of data and learn from it is revolutionizing fields like healthcare, education, and finance. However, these advancements come with risks. AI can perpetuate biases, invade privacy, or be used unethically if not developed responsibly.

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="responsible-ai-vs.-ai-ethics">Responsible AI vs.&nbsp;AI Ethics</h2>
<p>While Responsible AI and AI Ethics are closely related, they are not identical. AI Ethics focuses broadly on the philosophical and moral questions surrounding AI, while Responsible AI is more practical, emphasizing the implementation of ethical considerations in measurable ways. It involves using clear metrics and frameworks to ensure that AI systems align with ethical principles.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-global-regulatory-landscape">The Global Regulatory Landscape</h2>
<p>Regulation of AI is still evolving, but several regions are leading the way. The European Union‚Äôs AI Act classifies AI systems based on risk levels and imposes stringent requirements on high-risk applications. In the United States, initiatives like the AI Bill of Rights and various state-level regulations are shaping AI governance. Countries like Canada, the UK, and China are also developing frameworks tailored to their societal and economic needs.</p>
<p>These regulatory efforts share a common goal: to protect human rights while fostering innovation in AI. As AI technology continues to advance, these regulations will play a critical role in ensuring that AI systems are used responsibly.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-importance-of-diversity-in-ai-development">The Importance of Diversity in AI Development</h2>
<p>Diversity, equity, and inclusion (DE&amp;I) are essential for creating fair and unbiased AI systems. A lack of diversity in AI development teams can lead to systems that reflect and reinforce societal biases. For instance, facial recognition systems and hiring algorithms have been shown to produce biased results when developed without diverse perspectives.</p>
<p>Research shows that diverse teams are more innovative and perform better. Prioritizing DE&amp;I in AI development is not just ethically sound but also beneficial for business, leading to more robust and inclusive AI solutions.</p>
