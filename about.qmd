Lukman Jibril Aliyu is a dedicated pharmacist and a passionate machine learning and AI enthusiast. I graduated with a Bachelor of Pharmacy from Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria, in 2017. My career spans diverse experiences in hospital settings, community pharmacies, and supply agencies.

Currently, I work at Zipline, Nigeria, as a Fulfillment Operations Professional, where I contribute to the efficient delivery of medical products. My responsibilities include online collaboration with high-performing teams, customer care service, order processing, packaging, and inventory management.

In addition to my professional role, I am an active participant in the Arewa Data Science Academy. As a fellow and now a mentor, I have built high-performing machine learning models, taught data science, and achieved recognition by securing second place in the Cohere AI Hack.

My journey into the world of machine learning began with the Arewa Data Science Academy fellowship in January 2023. Since then, I have been exploring the intersection of healthcare and artificial intelligence, focusing on biostatistics in public health. I am particularly interested in using machine learning to improve health outcomes and address challenges in low-resource settings.

I blog about my learning journey, sharing insights and experiences as I navigate the realms of healthcare and machine learning. My goal is to contribute to the growing body of knowledge in these fields and inspire others to explore the potential of AI in healthcare.
