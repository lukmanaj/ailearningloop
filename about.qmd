I am a passionate and dedicated professional with a background in Pharmacy and a strong focus on Artificial
Intelligence and Machine Learning in healthcare. I have proven experience in research, data science, and machine
learning, with a track record of high-performing model development and publication. I currently work at
Zipline, ensuring the delivery of medical supplies using innovative solutions. I am highly skilled in data analysis,
programming, and interprofessional collaboration to improve patient outcomes and advance healthcare
delivery.

In addition to my professional role, I am an active participant at the Arewa Data Science Academy, where as a fellow and now a mentor, I have built high-performing machine learning models, taught data science, and achieved recognition by securing second place in the Cohere AI Hack. I am also an active moderator,mentor (for the DeepLearning.AI TensorFlow Developer Professional Certificate) and course tester at the `DeepLearning.AI Forum`.

My journey into the world of machine learning began with the Arewa Data Science Academy fellowship in January 2023. Since then, I have been exploring the intersection of healthcare and artificial intelligence, focusing on biostatistics in public health. I am particularly interested in using machine learning to improve health outcomes and address challenges in low-resource settings.

I blog about my learning journey, sharing insights and experiences as I navigate the realms of healthcare and machine learning. My goal is to contribute to the growing body of knowledge in these fields and inspire others to explore the potential of AI in healthcare.
